## Visual
### Matthew bird
He is known for his unsolicited projects notably Alphaomega Apartment where he developed his material technique of the ‘elaborative ready-made’ and theatrically transformed a tiny rental apartment unbeknown to the owners. Since the completion of this project he formed his architectural atelier Studiobird and has produced a range of architectural new build, interior design, installation art, performance and scenographic projects that individually and as a compilation advance a nontraditional and experimental model of architectural practice.
Studiobird project outcomes and associate practice methodologies fuel Bird’s teaching and research.
Bird has over ten years experience as a practicing architect, working for some of Melbourne’s premiere architecture firms; Cassandra Complex, ARM Architecture and internationally on a range of institutional, commercial, residential, hospitality, retail and interior focused projects.

### Robert Jacks
Born in Melbourne, Australia. He studied sculpture from 1958 to 1960 at the Prahran Technical College, Melbourne, and painting in 1961 and 1962 at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (now RMIT University).

In 1966 he had his first solo exhibition at Gallery A, Melbourne from which a work was purchased for the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1968, he participated in ‘The Field’ an extremely influential exhibition at the new National Gallery of Victoria, which effectively launched color field abstraction in Australia.
